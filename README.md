## Solution: 5 Growth Initiatives

Our team proposed and validated five data-driven initiatives combining customer insights, competitive analysis, and financial projections.

### 1. Self-Service Kiosks
**Problem**: Long queues during peak hours reduce customer satisfaction  
**Solution**: Deploy 750 self-service kiosks across network  
**Impact**:
- **Payback**: 3.5 months per location
- **Revenue lift**: +4.5% per location
- **Investment**: ₽858M (₽1.14M per location)
- **Opex savings**: ₽350K/month (staff reduction)

### 2. Seasonal Holiday Menu
**Problem**: Limited seasonal offerings during high-demand periods  
**Solution**: Launch holiday menu (glühwein, gingerbread cookies, mandarin pizza, pastries)  
**Impact**:
- **ROI**: 48-57%
- **Payback**: 1 season (53.3%)
- **Revenue lift**: +1.3% company-wide

### 3. 24/7 Night Operations
**Problem**: Missing nighttime demand in major cities  
**Solution**: Operate 16 locations (160 units) with night shifts (23:00-03:00)  
**Impact**:
- **Monthly revenue**: ₽264M
- **Net profit**: ₽24.5M/month
- **Market capture**: +2.7% order volume

### 4. Strategic Location Expansion
**Problem**: Existing locations poorly positioned vs. high-traffic zones  
**Solution**: Open 16 new units near offices, universities, and mall food courts  
**Impact**:
- **Revenue per location**: ₽8.4M/month
- **Company-wide lift**: +2.01%
- **Investment**: ₽25M per location

### 5. Solo Combo Meals
**Problem**: Limited options for single diners (only 5% of current traffic)  
**Solution**: Launch discounted combo meals targeting solo customers  
**Impact**:
- **Revenue lift**: ₽32.8M
- **Payback**: 2 months
- **Order volume**: +1%

## Overall Impact

**Combined effect**: +10.63% company-wide revenue growth
